# Bagging-and-Boosting-Project

Skills Used: Python, Pandas, SKLearn, Bagging Boosting Models

Project Objective: Deployed Bagging and Boosting models to classify app-based transactions as fraudlent or not.

Quantifiable Results: For XGB Classifier auc the score was 0.8941. For baggingClassifier Classifier the auc score was 0.871

Explored the dataset for anomalies and missing values
By using Pandas derive new features
Applied XGBoostClassifier with default parameters
Calculated AUC/ROC score with default hyperparameters.
Computed feature importance score and name the top 5 features/columns
Applyied BaggingClassifier with base_estimator LogisticRegression and compute AUC/ROC score.
On the basis of AUC/ROC score compared BaggingClassifier and XGBoostClassifier
